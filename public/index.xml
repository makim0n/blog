      <description>Reading rainbow 0_Network_Enumeration    Event Challenge Category Points Solves     TamuCTF 2019 0_Network_Enumeration Reading rainbow 100 ~499    Description  Recently, the office put up a private webserver to store important information about the newest research project for the company. This information was to be kept confidential, as it&amp;rsquo;s release could mean a large loss for everyone in the office. Just as the research was about to be published, a competing firm published information eerily similar.</description>

      <description>Introduction Whether in &amp;ldquo;Capture The Flag&amp;rdquo; (CTF) events or even in professional life, we work with network captures. PCAP (Packet capture), is rich in information. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in the amount of information and start on wrong tracks. Throughout this MOOC, I will introduce you the methodology to be adopted to deal with this type of situation. Firstly, I will try to describe the PCAP content, list some tools and finally practical exercises resulting from CTF tests or malicious traffic.</description>

Why ? Because I wanted to share my little challenges and try to teach you something, the knowledge sharing is the most important thing in infosec ;)
Who ? Mainly me, but if someone wants to store his task, I can host it.
Where ? In my basement.
Looking for my writeups ? You can find all my writeups on the Aperi&amp;rsquo;Kube website or here, in the Walktrough category!</description>

      <title>Doing CTF without paying VPS</title>

      <description>The goal I think many of us do CTFs, but also many of us don&amp;rsquo;t have any money, because we&amp;rsquo;re student or addict to drugs. So when you don&amp;rsquo;t have any money, you get creative.
 
For webguys who are looking for a reverse shell or who want admin cookies on a remote host (hello root-me), but don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for a VPS, there is a free solution.</description>

      <description>The goal I always wanted to learn how to use requests library in Python3. It&amp;rsquo;s very helpful in daily life or in CTF&amp;hellip;
And actually, there is EuropeanCyberWeek CTF, so let&amp;rsquo;s try to do something useful: Auto flag submitter
State of the art First of all, I need the requests structure, to get this information, just open BurpSuite (if you&amp;rsquo;re a bit stupid like me), or you&amp;rsquo;re Firefox web console and request the chosen challenge (Drone Wars 3 for example).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m playing CTF with Aperi&amp;rsquo;Kube and my main interests are forensic, realistic pentest, hardware and electronic stuff.
Feel free to contact me on twitter to chat about what you want! Come in the next conference to take a beer :D
Hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy and laugh reading my blog, cya &amp;lt;3

      <description>In this article, I will introduce you to Odie&amp;rsquo;s misfortunes. Odie is a final year student at ENSIBS Cyberdefense (France). He is also the biggest fan of the famous band: Iron Maiden. In addition to that, he built a small fan website for them on his Virtual Private Server. Given that, Odie is a poor student, he only owns one VPS for his tests, courses and others stuff. But, Odie comes from the most prestigious school in cyberdefense, then he knows how to protect himself against awful hackers&amp;hellip; Well, almost.</description>

      <description>Picture from OtterCTF, awesome logo! :D 
In this short article, I will present some challenges of OtterCTF. I will begin with a memory dump challenge suite, it contains a little ransomware. This scenario is really interesting for people who like playing with some forensic stuff. At the end of this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about network task too.
Memory dump The memory dump to analyze can be found at this address: https://mega.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll share the whole journey that lead me to this event, not just the CTF in itself. It is a totally subjective point of view, so the &amp;ldquo;jump to section&amp;rdquo; tool might come in handy if some parts seem useless to you.
First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ll start by catching up on the &amp;ldquo;Nuit du Hack&amp;rdquo; event, where it all started for some of the members of the Apéri&amp;rsquo;Kube, Hexpresso and Inshall&amp;rsquo;hack teams.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this university project, we had to study the how buildroot works and set up different features with it.
First part will deal with setting up the system basis. Next part will explain how buildroot can be configured, adding default package or adding an external package.
I. Step 1 In this first part, we had to set up the buildroot system basis.
Goals of this part are:

      <description>Introduction First of all, thanks, Black Hat to win places for a student! I filled the annual survey and that happens, it’s crazy! Then, me and 3 my friends (see below) went to London!
 @GregoireMolveau @razaborg @L4rg0_W1nch  All briefing was interesting, but the most impressive one was on Intel ME from Mark Ermolov, Maxim Goryachy and Dimitry SKLYAROV
I’ll present this article by day and briefing. At the end of each briefing, I’ll add a personal point of view.</description>
