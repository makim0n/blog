#### Description

> Recently, the office put up a private webserver to store important information about the newest research project for the company. This information was to be kept confidential, as it's release could mean a large loss for everyone in the office.
> Just as the research was about to be published, a competing firm published information eerily similar. Too similar...
> Time to take a look through the office network logs to figure out what happened.

    - What is the IP address of the private webserver?
    - How many hosts made contact with the private webserver that day?

In this task, the challenge deal with a PCAP file, I let you check my article about [PCAP analysis](/articles/wiresharkhowtobasic/).

The first flag is to find the internal IP address of a web server. Since PCAP is quite large, I just have to load it into `Capanalysis` and filter on the __SSL__ and __HTTP__ protocols, then filter on the IP that receives the most data:

<center>
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/0_netenum_chall11.png)
_Fig 1_: Web server IP address
</center>

It was the web server we were looking for:

	Flag 1: 192.168.11.4

Now the second challenge is to find the number of IP addresses that have connected to this webserver. Since we know his IP address, with `tshark` it's pretty easy:

```bash
▶ tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "ip.dst == 192.168.11.4" -Tfields -e 'ip.src' | sort | uniq
128.194.165.200
172.217.6.138
172.226.209.130
192.168.1.1
192.168.11.5
192.168.11.7
192.168.11.8
192.168.11.9
35.222.85.5
35.224.99.156
52.43.40.243
54.213.168.194
91.189.92.38

▶ tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "ip.dst == 192.168.11.4" -Tfields -e 'ip.src' | sort | uniq | wc -l
13
```

Fortunately, all connections are done on the same day::

	Flag 2: 13

### 1_Discovery

    - What is the IP address of the host exfiltrating data?
    - For how long did the exfiltration happen? (Round to the nearest second. Format: MM:SS)
    - What protocol/s was used to exfiltrate data? (Alphabetical order, all caps, comma separated, with spaces - ex: ABCD, BBCD)

It's time to open this big PCAP file in Wireshark. Thanks to the first question, we know that the attack exfiltrates some data. The best filter for that is still: `data.data`:

<center>
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/1_disco_chall11.png)
_Fig 2_: Suspicious ICMP traffic
</center>

We can see that our web server (192.168.11.4) is chatting with another host (192.168.11.7) via weird ICMP requests. Let's see what these requests contain:

<center>
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/1_disco_chall12.png)
_Fig 3_: Filter on data
</center>

If we get the first request with a `tshark`:

```bash
▶ tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "data.data && ip.dst == 192.168.11.4" -Tfields -e 'data.text' | head -n 1 | xxd -r -p
SEx4IRV.746f74616c6c795f6e6f7468696e672e706466.REGISTER.6156eab6691f32b8350c45b3fc4aadc1               
```

The data formatted like this looks a lot like the [DET (Data Exfiltration Toolkit)](https://github.com/sensepost/DET) framework. I had already talked about it in a writeup at the [SantHackLause 2018](/walkthrough/santhacklaus2018/#mission-impossible-2).

	Flag 1: 192.168.11.7

Now we have to determine the duration of the exfiltration. With a small filter on IPs, we see some interesting things in the `DNS`:

<center>
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/1_disco_chall21.png)
_Fig 4_: Suspicious domain name
</center>

If we extract the last DNS request and this is indeed the last DET request, we should find a "DONE":

```bash
▶ echo -n '534578344952562e35312e444f4e45' | xxd -r -p                          
SEx4IRV.51.DONE
```

Perfect, we know the first request with the "REGISTER" and the last one with the "DONE".

<center>
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/1_disco_chall23.png)
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/1_disco_chall22.png)
_Fig 5_: Timestamp
</center>

```bash
▶ echo $((35.49-24.40))                               
11.090000000000003
```

The exfiltration lasted 11 minutes and 9 seconds:

	Flag 2: 11.09

The last step will be the simplest, we already have all the information, to find the protocols, we will do a little tshark trick:

```bash
▶ tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "ip.src == 192.168.11.4 && ip.dst == 192.168.11.7" -Tfields -e '_ws.col.Protocol' | sort | uniq 
DNS
HTTP
ICMP
TCP
```

The "TCP" protocol is not counted since it is a transport protocol (see OSI Model).

	Flag 3: DNS, HTTP, ICMP

### 2_Exfiltration

| Event        | Challenge             | Category        | Points | Solves |
|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| TamuCTF 2019 | 2_Exfiltration        | Reading rainbow | 100    | ~96    |


    - What is the name of the stolen file?
    - What is the md5sum of the stolen file?

These questions are a little bit easy since we know that the attacker used DET. First request contains both flags:

	SEx4IRV.746f74616c6c795f6e6f7468696e672e706466.REGISTER.6156eab6691f32b8350c45b3fc4aadc1

* SEx4IRV
* 746f74616c6c795f6e6f7468696e672e706466
* REGISTER
* 6156eab6691f32b8350c45b3fc4aadc1

The first hexadecimal sequence is the name of the encoded extracted file:

```bash
▶ echo -n '746f74616c6c795f6e6f7468696e672e706466' | xxd -r -p                              
totally_nothing.pdf
```

	Flag 1: totally_nothing.pdf

The second hexadecimal sequence is the MD5 hash of the encoded extracted file:

	Flag 2: 6156eab6691f32b8350c45b3fc4aadc1

### 3_Data

| Event        | Challenge             | Category        | Points | Solves |
|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| TamuCTF 2019 | 3_Data                | Reading rainbow | 100    | ~79    |


    - What compression encoding was used for the data?
    - What is the name and type of the decompressed file? (Format: NAME.TYPE e.g. tamuctf.txt)

Before answering the questions, it will be necessary to find a way to recover the original file. We know that the attacker used HTTP, DNS and ICMP protocols between IP 192.168.11.7 (attacker) and 192.168.11.4 (webserver) to extract his file. We will, therefore, use the following filter and save only the displayed packets to make a lightened PCAP file:

	ip.src == 192.168.11.4 && ip.dst == 192.168.11.7 && (http || dns || icmp

<center>
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/3_exfil_chall11.png)
_Fig 6_: Lightweight PCAP
</center>

We go from 15k packets to 117, it's still more pleasant to analyze.

#### Get data from ICMP

ICMP data is sent in hexadecimal when decoding on the fly with `xxd` piped to `tshark` there is no more line break and the data becomes difficult to analyze. For that, there is `sed` which will add more returns to the line:

```bash
▶ tshark -r exfil.pcap -Y "icmp" -Tfields -e "data.text" | xxd -r -p | sed 's/SEx4IRV/\nSEx4IRV/g'
SEx4IRV.746f74616c6c795f6e6f7468696e672e706466.REGISTER.6156eab6691f32b8350c45b3fc4aadc1
SEx4IRV.2.85a846255178c4cbbd77ee999d7b7736892afaa392cf6ae7ccf9ee39f79efb9c3367325a767c1c7db414c0d4dadc4c78b0b5
SEx4IRV.12.2bb53aaf40c5354868c984db4df8b209379f172b26dcbc5f6e99f04a130ef3e234f944e875a64f746d26fc920977987079ee
[...]

▶ tshark -r exfil.pcap -Y "icmp" -Tfields -e "data.text" | xxd -r -p | sed 's/SEx4IRV/\nSEx4IRV/g' > clear_icmp
```

These are the ICMP data extracted from a file.

#### Get data from HTTP

HTTP data are sent as POST data:

<center>
![](/img/writeups/tamuctf2019/readingrainbow/3_exfil_chall12.png)
_Fig 7_: HTTP hex encoded data
</center>

Same process as for ICMP:

```bash
▶ tshark -r exfil.pcap -Y "http" -Tfields -e urlencoded-form.value | xxd -r -p | sed 's/SEx4IRV/\nSEx4IRV/g'               
SEx4IRV.0.1f8b080094e16c5c0003ed596b6c1c5715beb30f7b9dd8eb4dea249b07cdb64d8493ca9b5d3b7ea4698877fd1a83ed98d40e
SEx4IRV.1.01ea4cd7deb1bdb00f6b77b6d8018125a755b7a94390a0ca1f50a5a20a103f5ca844040236b82a25bf1250451005b9555339
SEx4IRV.3.3960e6981a034d81000a36ed6f6a0ab6049a5b5a5120d818686c41bec047ec17a56c468ba47d3ea44512d931adfc50dcadfc

▶ tshark -r exfil.pcap -Y "http" -Tfields -e urlencoded-form.value | xxd -r -p | sed 's/SEx4IRV/\nSEx4IRV/g' > clear_http
```

#### Get data from DNS

The functioning of the DNS is a bit more different, because each request will be encoded in another.

```bash
▶ tshark -r exfil.pcap -Y "dns" -Tfields -e dns.qry.name | cut -d'.' -f2 | xxd -r -p | sed 's/SEx4IRV/\nSEx4IRV/g'
SEx4IRV.5.a6cb22df81782e99b8f30efd5976f11c219f61477c5da8d1d1851a1fc79f60ed4ed9783b1bb3cb33bb3cd307bec21c5b11fa
SEx4IRV.7.d868cbfe7df168433c96cc4e374cb7b534b4ecf76752fe46ea9387e9f60c0c537d32df30b4a4bc8e61a4fcedfa9fff74f35f
SEx4IRV.8.af6baf4c5fb9f1cbf7479e0bfce2f22b44d7858af346e66396d9137c6238025db0a4cf2098419e36e0ff460bbca10cee2d83

▶ tshark -r exfil.pcap -Y "dns" -Tfields -e dns.qry.name | cut -d'.' -f2 | xxd -r -p | sed 's/SEx4IRV/\nSEx4IRV/g' > clear_dns
```

#### Ordering each request

All requests must be put back in the right order. This is how DET works:

1. File ID
2. Packet number
3. Data

This query construction is not valid for the first (REGISTER) and last (DONE) requests.
To put all this in order, python will do it for us. I will put all the lines in a dictionary with the packet number as the key:

```python
f = open('clear_data')
a = f.read()
f.close()

final = ""
tmp = {}

for i in range(0,len(a)):
	tmp[int(a[i].split('.')[1])] = a[i].split('.')[2]

for j in range(0,len(tmp)):
	final = tmp[j]

g = open('result','wb')
g.write(final)
g.close()
```

Here is what we obtain:

```bash
▶ file result 
result: ASCII text, with very long lines, with no line terminators

▶ cat result                    
1f8b080094e16c5c0003ed596b6c1c5715beb30f7b9dd8eb4dea249b07cdb64d8493ca9b5d3b7ea4698877fd1a83ed98d40e01ea4cd7deb1bdb00f6b7
[...]

▶ cat result | xxd -r -p > test 

▶ file test    
test: gzip compressed data, last modified: Wed Feb 20 05:11:48 2019, from Unix, original size 10240
```

Remember the first question of the challenge is the type of compression used:

	Flag 1: gzip

Now, let's uncompress the archive and got the original file:

```bash
▶ mv test test.gz                                                             
                                                                        
▶ gzip -d test.gz            
                                                                        
▶ file test 
test: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
                                                                          
▶ tar xvf test    
stuff                                                                            
▶ file stuff 
stuff: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=e228bab316deed74b478d8f5bdef5d8c30bbd1b4, not stripped
```

And now, let's validate the last flag: 

	Flag 2: stuff.elf

    - What is the IP Address of the attacker?

For this flag I don't have any real analysis, I just opened the PCAP file and looked at the different TCP conversations. The IP that sends the most data and voila:

Once the archive is finally downloaded, we'll mount it in readonly to avoid screwing everything inside:

```bash
▶ mkdir aaa
▶ sudo mount -o ro filesystem.image aaa
```

We know the attacker's IP (10.91.9.93) and we are looking for a connection. Let's see what the `auth.log` file contains:

```bash

```

We got all flags immediately:

	Flag 1: root

    - What specific line in the initial compromising file was the most dangerous? (Actual line, spaces in front don't matter)

During an investigation, my first reflex is to go to the folders of the different users (`/home`, `/root`):

```

We will search in the `/etc/passwd` file if there are no other users who have can access to a __bash__:

```bash

```

It's funny, the user `dev` has `/root` as $HOME directory...

We see a `docker-composes.yml` file in the user's directory __ubuntu__:

If you're a little familiar with Docker, you've already found out where the attacker went. Line 13 of the file, the user is mounting the root directory in the /tmp folder of the container:

	- /:/tmp

As a result, the attacker compromised the webfront and got access to the  host filesystem as `root` user. So he was able to retrieve the SSH private key from the host and logged in with.

The MD5 hash of the docker-composer.yml:

```bash
➜  microservices md5sum aaa/home/ubuntu/docker-compose.yml
a2111283f69aafcd658f558b0402fbc4  aaa/home/ubuntu/docker-compose.yml
```

	Flag 1: docker
	Flag 2: a2111283f69aafcd658f558b0402fbc4
	Flag 3: - /:/tmp

> Thanks for that information. It seems that one of our developers didn't pay attention to what he was copying off of the internet. Can you help use figure out the extent of what the attacker was able to do?

    - What are the last names of customers who got compromised? (alphabetical order, Capitalized first letter, comma separated ex: Asdf,Bsdf)
    - What is the md5sum of the file that was used to exfiltrate data initially?
    - What is the md5sum of the file that was stolen after the attacker logged in?

Something to know when you're doing forensic work with docker is: absolutely ALL about containers and other files/information related to this service is located here: `/var/lib/docker`.

Let's list the docker containers that have been used. We'll go looking for the one who climbs the root in the /tmp folder of the container:

```bash
➜  microservices ls aaa/var/lib/docker/containers 
90814f0051eed67a4dd291c8e3f44836c3cf3bd793818eba2e9ae7d0eedc661e

```

Each container created contains a configuration file in JSON:

```bash
➜  microservices ls aaa/var/lib/docker/containers/*/config*
aaa/var/lib/docker/containers/90814f0051eed67a4dd291c8e3f44836c3cf3bd793818eba2e9ae7d0eedc661e/config.v2.json

A surprising image is here: __kaliimage__. Image Docker which has nothing to do on a web server...

In the `/var/lib/lib/docker/overlay2/` folder there are all the intermediate versions of the docker containers, in the form of a hash. Kind of like the commits for GitHub.

```bash
➜  microservices ls aaa/var/lib/docker/overlay2

``` 

Each of these folders has the same architecture:

```bash

```

The folder that will interest us will be the `diff` one, which bears its name well because it will record the differences between each container version. That's why Docker quickly becomes greedy in terms of disk size.

To find what interests me, I did something not very skilled, but which has is exhaustive:

```bash
➜  microservices ls aaa/var/lib/docker/overlay2/*/diff/
aaa/var/lib/docker/overlay2/0dfa81ec47cc9d78701052f24ce164b114279abb425af227eb7664624d64c848/diff/:

It's Christmas, we found the file modified by the attacker and what allowed him to do yolo with the system. He modified database entries, retrieved `/etc/shadow`, information about users' `.ssh` folders.

The compromised users are therefore:

	Flag 1: Billy,Face,Frank,John,Meserole,Orange,Suzy

The file that was used to extract data from the data is therefore `entry.sh`:

	Flag 2: 14b0d800ce6f2882a6f058b45fc500c8

Still in the same perspective as to find the `entry.sh`, I listed the diff folders. In fact, I thought we were looking for a SQL backup or something like that, modifying a database without getting the backups is like ransomware that doesn't delete clear files...

> Thanks for that information. We are working on how to recover from this breach. One of the things we need to do is remove any backdoors placed by the attacker. Can you identify what the attacker left behind?

    - What is the new user that was created?
    - What is the full name of the new docker image that was pulled down?

This challenge was rather simple given the information found earlier. In step 2 (2_Analysis), I saw that the $HOME of the `dev` user is `/root`, so we suspect that it is the new user :

    Flag 1: dev

Then, when I started investigating on docker containers (cf. 3_Forensics), I saw an image __Kali__ named: `tamuctf/kaliimage`.

    - What is the url and channel of the IRC server that the one downloaded script tried to connect to? (url, channel)

In order to find the most used IP address for telnet and ssh, I just count, sort and print the first line:

```bash
